# Overview

The main Amazon website offered 488 million items in 2015. The average price of an item on Amazon is $26.86. Just as same as 1 bitcoin transaction's fee. This eliminates use of BTC during online payments. Who will buy 10$ socks and pay 20$ over it for transaction fee.

Bransfer Connect is SaaS for accepting Bitcoin payments. Connect is utilizing the existing infrastructure of crypto exchanges, by providing FREE and INSTANT Bitcoin payments. No transaction fee. No block confirmation time.

# How?

Every big crypto exchange ([Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), [Binance](https://binance.com), [Huobi](https://huobi.com), [KuCoin](https://kucoin.com)) allows internal transactions to be done free and instantly. Meaning if you want to transfer BTC from one binance account to another binance account it will not go throught blockchain and the amount will be instantly transfered without fees. 

We transfrom your Binance account to Payment processor. You create a Binance account (you probably have one already) and we use this account to accept Bitcoin payments. Your BTC doesn't go throught any 3'rd party, you just get it right away in your Binance account. We track all deposits that came to your account and appropreriatly report about it as any other payment provider will do.
